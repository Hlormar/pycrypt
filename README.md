Pycrypt is a simple console program for GPG encryption of any types of files, written with python using python-gnupg module
The program can:
- Generate public and private keys
- Encrypt/Decrypt files using generated keys

Usage:
You can view help by using -h or --help args.

To generate a keys use --key_gen. It accepts:
-key_type		(Default:RSA)
-key_lenghth	(Default:1024)
-name_real	(Default:Autogenerated Key)
-name_comment	(Default:Generated by gnupg.py)
-name_email	(Default:<username>@<hostname>)
-passhrase 	Optional, but necessary for decryption

example: pycrypt.exe --key_gen -name_real Michael -name_email LadyBug@mail2tor.com -passphrase Jvn46LHang2F
The program will create a "Keys" folder where from you launched app and a folder called with $name_real inside with keys $name_real_public.asc and $name_real_secret.asc

IMPORTANT(Windows): The program able to work only if there is gpg executable in "GPG" folder next to executable file

To encrypt a file use --encrypt. It accepts:
-file_raw		A path to file to be encrypted
-name_real	Username, who's public key will be used for enc

example: python pycrypt.py --encrypt -name_real Dean -file_raw c:\users\ghost\downloads\torbrowser.exe
The program will create a .gpg file with the same name next to original

IMPORTANT: The program able to enc/dec only using itself's keys, but not imported

To decrypt a file use --decrypt. It accepts:
-file_crypted	A path to file to be decrypted
-name_real	Username, who's secret key will be used for dec
-passphrase	Optional, but keys without passphrase unable to decrypt

example: pycrypt.exe --decrypt -name_real kleo -passphrase horny123 -file_crypted c:\users\ghost\desktop\passwords.txt.gpg
The program will create a file at the same place with the same name as original but without .gpg

IMPORTANT: The program works properly only with .gpg  files
